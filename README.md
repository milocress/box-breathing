# Box Breathing

Supposedly this breathing technique can help you lower your RHR without having to do the kind of cardio that might actually qualify as a workout. Also, my subjective experience after doing this for a day is that the meditative experience of forcing myself to focus on my breathing and nothing else for ten minutes is quite helpful for dealing with stress.

I got GPT-4 to write this webapp for me with ~20 minutes of tinkering because I couldn't find anything online without an annoying amount of ads, which rather defeats the "meditation and focus" aspect of the breathing exercise IMO.

## Instructions
- Go to [https://milocress.github.io/box-breathing/](https://milocress.github.io/box-breathing/) and enter the amount of time you'd like each 'side' of the box to take. My trainer said it's best to start with 4 seconds and work your way up. Press `Start` when you're ready.

- Follow the instuctions on the screen: when it says "Inhale", inhale -- you get the idea.

The progress bar doesn't always line up with the instructions (I prodded GPT for a while to fix this but only made it worse) so treat the text instructions as the ground truth and the progress bar as a hint.
